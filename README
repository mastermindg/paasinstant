# PAAS BUILDER

### Introduction
--------------------
The goal of this project is to build a Platform-As-A-Service system capable of Higly Available, Fault Tolerant scaling.

### Requirements
------------------
- Scalable (can add more nodes at will)
- Highly-Available (you can reach any running nodes easily)
- Fault-Tolerant (nodes going down won't affect the overall users)
- Replicatable (everything lives in code)

### Architecture
----------------
- Docker 1.12 for containers
- Keepalived for VIP's
- HAProxy for LB
- Docker Swarm for Service Discovery and scaling

### Demo Cluster
------------
- 2 LB's (HAProxy, KeepaliveD)
- 2 Docker manager nodes
- 4 Docker worker nodes

#### Installing
```./build.sh demo/paas.json```

### TODOs
-----
- Scale Load-Balancers
- Base image physical hosts
